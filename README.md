# Nexter - Real Estate Website (CSS Grid & SASS)

This is a real estate website, **Nexter**, built as part of my learning journey with CSS Grid. The project showcases how CSS Grid can be used to create a flexible and responsive layout for displaying property listings. The website is designed to be desktop-first and is fully responsive across different screen sizes.

## Features
- Fully responsive layout designed using CSS Grid
- Styled using SASS (CSS preprocessor)
- Clean and user-friendly interface
- Desktop-first design
